# Project Name
Insurance Agency Customer Feedback Form


## Description
In this project, I created a customer feedback form for an insurance agency.
The feedback for asks 4 questions about the customers recent interaction with thier agent.
Each question asks for a rating of 1-5, with 5 meaning they had an outstanding experience.
After the questions are cpmplete, the user will see a review page displaying the respective input.
Last, the customer will see a thank you page.

Upon submit, all data is stored in a database for future reference.
